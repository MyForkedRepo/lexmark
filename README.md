# Lexmark printer stuff

This repository contains all the work related to Lexmark printers I've released to the public.
Most of you are probably here for the firmware decryption utilities; check the [`tools`](./tools/) folder.

The [`exploit`](./exploit/) folder contains an (at the time) 0day exploit I developed that apparently affected
over [100 different](https://publications.lexmark.com/publications/security-alerts/CVE-2023-23560.pdf) Lexmark printer models. This exploit was originally developed for Pwn2Own Toronto 2022, and magically failed during the actual competition. ZDI offered to buy the bug(s) anyway for a laughable monetary amount and I promptly forgot about their offer.

As usual: everything is distributed as-is, don't expect support/updates.

Enjoy!
